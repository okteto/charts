# Memcached

[Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/) is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

This chart bootstraps a [Memcached](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-memcached) deployment on the [Okteto Cloud](https://okteto.com/) Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Refer to the [original chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/memcached) for advanced parameter configuration.
