To access your terminal, click on the URL displayed in the Okteto Cloud UI, and type your username and password.

{{- if .Values.credentials }}

Username: "{{ (split ":" .Values.credentials)._0 }}"  
Password: "{{ (split ":" .Values.credentials)._1 }}"
{{- end }}

The terminal is already configured with okteto, kubectl and helm, and runs with namespace-wide permissions.
